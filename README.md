**Access Management for Global Healthcare**

**Background:**

As a result of today's fast-paced lifestyle, people are always on the move,
whether travelling or relocating, making it difficult to maintain and carry
physical medical records, hindering them from getting the best health care.
In this way, hospitals, doctors, and patients can access patient information
remotely and on-demand, making the diagnosis-treatment process faster
and more efficient.

**Mission Statement:**

"To inspire and contribute to health and well-being by providing the most
efficient and agile access to healthcare records globally through database
management systems."
